# 🏅 Olympic Biathlon Medal Analysis (1960–2022)

### ✅ Mini Project – AI/ML Internship  
**Domain:** Sports Analytics  
**Dataset:** Olympic Medals in Biathlon, 1960–2022  
**Submitted by:** Nikita Yadav  

---

## 📌 Project Description

This mini-project focuses on performing basic data analysis on a real-world Olympic dataset, specifically analyzing **Biathlon**, a Winter Olympic sport. The goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding **medal distribution**, **country-wise performance**, and **event-wise dominance** from 1960 to 2022.

By narrowing the scope to a single sport (Biathlon), this project adds **uniqueness** and depth compared to general Olympic medal studies.

## 🧠 Objectives

- 📊 Bar plots by Olympic year (medal trends over time)  
- 🌍 Compare country-wise medal performance  
- 📈 Medals per capita (normalized by population)  
- 🥇 Event-wise dominance within Biathlon  

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

- **Source:** CSV file titled `biathlon_medals.csv`  
- **Entries:** 286 records  
- **Columns:**  
  - `event_title` – Biathlon event type  
  - `medal` – Gold/Silver/Bronze  
  - `country` – Representing nation  
  - `athlete` – Athlete name (optional)  
  - `gender` – Gender of athlete or team  
  - `year` – Olympic year  
  - `city` – Host city  
  - ... and more

## 📈 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Total Medals per Olympic Year
Visualized using a **bar plot** to identify trends in Biathlon medal awards from 1960–2022.

### 2. Country-Wise Medal Performance
Used a **pivot table and line chart** to compare medal performance of the top countries (e.g., Norway, Germany, France).

### 3. Medals Per Capita
Calculated normalized medal counts using estimated population values to highlight **performance efficiency**.

### 4. Event-Wise Dominance
Analyzed and plotted medal counts by **specific Biathlon events** (e.g., Sprint, Pursuit, Relay).

1. Clone the repository or download the files  
2. Install dependencies (optional):  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open Mini Project1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells to view results and visualizations

📝 Conclusion
Norway has the highest Biathlon medal count from 1960–2022

Medal trends have grown steadily post-2000

Smaller countries like Norway perform extremely well per capita

Certain events (e.g., 20km Individual, Mixed Relay) see high medal activity
